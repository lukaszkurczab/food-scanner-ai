## Project Context

- Stack: Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.79.x, React 19, TypeScript.
- Backend/services: Firebase (auth, firestore, storage), RevenueCat (react-native-purchases), i18next.
- Tooling: ESLint v8, tsc typecheck.

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature modules as the default:** new functionality goes into `feature/<FeatureName>/` which contains its own `screens/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `types/` (as needed). Code inside a feature is **private by default** and should not be imported by other features.
- **Global code is opt-in:** only move code to global folders (`components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `utils/`, `theme/`, `navigation/`, `types/`) if it is reused by **2+ features** or is a true app-wide concern (e.g., design system, auth, analytics, core navigation).
- **No feature-to-feature imports:** features must not import from other features directly. If shared logic/UI emerges, extract to the appropriate global layer and import from there.
- **Clear ownership:** a file belongs either to exactly one feature module **or** to the global layer—avoid “half-shared” code living in a feature but used globally.
- **Stable boundaries:** public surface of global modules should be small and typed; features can change internally without breaking the rest of the app.

### Naming, Imports, and Boundaries

- **Path aliases:** prefer `@/` alias imports over relative imports for cross-folder references (e.g., `@/components/...`, `@/services/...`, `@/feature/<FeatureName>/...`).
- **Import direction:** `screens` -> `feature/*` internals -> global layers -> SDKs. Never import `screens` from anywhere.
- **Feature privacy:** only import from inside the same `feature/<FeatureName>/...` unless extracting to global.
- **Cross-feature reuse rule:** if code is needed in another feature, extract it to a global folder; do not “reach into” another feature’s internals.
- **Naming conventions:**
  - React components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `MealCameraScreen.tsx`, `MacroChart.tsx`)
  - Hooks: `useXxx` (e.g., `useMeals.ts`, `usePremiumStatus.ts`)
  - Services: `xxxService.ts` (e.g., `streakService.ts`, `nutritionTableService.ts`)
  - Types: `types/*.ts` or `feature/<Feature>/types/*.ts` with explicit exported types
- **Export policy:** prefer named exports; use default export for screens and top-level components only when consistent with the codebase.
- **Barrels:** avoid `index.ts` barrel exports unless already established in the repo; explicit imports reduce accidental coupling.

## Operating Mode

- For any non-trivial task (>= 3 steps, architectural choice, or ambiguous requirements): start with a short plan (bullets).
- If something goes sideways or assumptions change: stop, re-plan, and explain.
- Prefer the smallest correct change. Avoid refactors unless requested.

## Refactor Loop (required)

Applies to any non-trivial task (>= 3 steps), architectural change, refactor, boundary cleanup, or import-graph change.

### Refactor trigger keywords

A task is considered a refactor if it includes any of:

- "refactor", "boundary", "imports", "architecture", "extract", "move file", "decouple"

### Preflight (default)

Before editing code, run:

1. `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__propose_frontend_approaches`
   - Input: task description + constraints from this file.
   - Output: 2–3 approaches + recommended approach.

2. `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__frontend_risk_check`
   - Input: chosen approach + known hotspots.
   - Output: risks + regression vectors + test checklist + rollback plan.

Skip preflight only if the user explicitly says **"skip preflight"**.

### Hard requirement (tool-before-edit)

For refactors/boundary work: **do not edit any files** until both MCP tools have been called:

- `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__propose_frontend_approaches`
- `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__frontend_risk_check`

If MCP tools are unavailable or time out: **stop and report**; do not proceed with edits.

### Execution

- Implement **PR1 only** (smallest correct change). Do not start PR2 unless the user says **"continue"**.
- Keep diffs small and behavior unchanged unless explicitly requested.

### Quality Gate (must pass)

Always run and report results:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`

If a gate fails: fix and re-run (max 3 attempts). If still failing: stop and report the top blockers with file/line and a minimal next step.

## Codebase First

- Search the repo for existing patterns (navigation, hooks, services, theme, i18n) and follow them.
- Do not introduce new dependencies or native modules unless explicitly requested.

## TypeScript / Quality Gates

- Do not weaken types to “make it compile” (avoid `any`, broad `as`, disabling rules) unless there is no alternative—then isolate and justify.
- Keep exports and public APIs stable; avoid breaking changes unless requested.
- If code touches cross-feature logic, prefer extracting to `services/` or `utils/` consistent with existing structure.

## React Native / Expo Constraints

- Prefer Expo-compatible APIs and existing dependencies; avoid adding custom native code.
- When touching camera/media/filesystem: respect platform permissions and failure states (denied, restricted, limited).
- Be mindful of performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders, heavy work on render path, and large images in memory.

## Firebase Rules

- Never log or persist secrets. Do not hardcode API keys or service credentials.
- Firestore: prefer predictable document shapes, explicit typing, and minimal reads/writes.
- Handle offline/latency: assume network can fail; provide user-safe fallbacks where relevant.

## RevenueCat Rules

- Do not change entitlement/offerings naming assumptions without checking existing constants/usages.
- Subscription state handling must be consistent and resilient (cache vs remote, sandbox vs prod).

## i18n Rules

- All user-facing strings must be translated via i18next (no hardcoded UI strings), unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- When adding keys: keep naming consistent, and update all required locales.

## Verification Before Done

- Never claim “done” without verification.
- Always run: `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` (or `pnpm/yarn` equivalent in this repo).
- Run tests proportionally:
  - For isolated changes, run only targeted tests for touched files/features (e.g., `npm run test -- src/hooks/__tests__/useMeals.test.ts`).
  - When running only part of the test suite with coverage enabled, scope coverage to touched source files using `--collectCoverageFrom` (e.g., `npm run test -- src/hooks/__tests__/useMeals.test.ts --collectCoverageFrom=src/hooks/useMeals.ts`).
  - Run full test suite for cross-feature changes, refactors, release prep, or when unsure about blast radius.
- If tests exist for the touched area: run them; otherwise provide a short manual verification checklist.
- For UI flows: list the exact screens/steps verified (iOS + Android if relevant).

## Bug-Fix Protocol

- Given a log/error: identify root cause and fix it (no band-aids).
- If multiple plausible causes: state top 1–2 hypotheses and the quickest confirmation path.
- Add a regression test when feasible; otherwise document reproducible steps.

## Frontend Review Tools

Use the dedicated frontend MCP tools when relevant:

- For feature privacy / extraction / cross-feature reuse:
  - `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__feature_boundary_check`
- For focused UI/manual verification planning:
  - `mcp__ollama_frontend_sidecar__ui_test_plan`

Use them when the task clearly benefits from a focused frontend review, not only for refactors.

## Communication (IDE)

For each change-set, include:

- What changed (1–3 bullets)
- Why
- How verified (commands run / steps)

## Guardrails

- No destructive actions (delete/migrate/overwrite data, breaking schema changes) without explicit confirmation.
- No output of personal data from logs/screenshots; redact identifiers.
- No secrets in code or logs. Never ask for or output API keys.

# Firebase

Durign work with firebase check firebaseRules.md and if it is necessery suggerst changes

## Backend sync

During tasks check if changes require other changes on backend part (fitaly-backend).

### Cross-repo contract checklist

When a change touches any of the surfaces below, **both repos must be updated**:

1. **Did this change alter a cross-repo contract?**
   - Meal type definitions (`MealType`, `MealSyncState`, `MealInputMethod`, `MealSource` in `types/meal.ts`)
   - NutritionState type shape (`nutritionStateTypes.ts`)
   - Gateway reject reasons (`GATEWAY_REJECT_REASONS` in `useChatHistory.ts`)
   - Habit signal enums (`NutritionTopRisk`, `NutritionCoachPriority`)
   - AI response types (`contracts.ts`)

2. **Were paired contract fixtures updated?**
   - Mobile: `src/__contract_fixtures__/*.json`
   - Backend: `tests/contract_fixtures/*.json`
   - These files must stay identical — copy after editing.

3. **Were paired tests updated?**
   - Mobile: `src/__contract_fixtures__/contractAlignment.test.ts`
   - Backend: `tests/test_contract_alignment.py`

4. **Verification:**
   - Mobile: `npx jest contractAlignment`
   - Backend: `pytest tests/test_contract_alignment.py`
